## Problem Statement (String to Integer Conversion)

Description:
You are required to create a function called `solution` that converts a string `s` into an integer and returns the result.

Constraints:
- The length of `s` is between 1 and 5, inclusive.
- The first character of `s` can be a sign (+ or -).
- `s` consists of signs and digits only.
- `s` does not start with "0".

Example:
For example, if `s` is "1234", the function should return 1234, and if `s` is "-1234", it should return -1234.
`s` consists only of signs (+ or -) and digits, and there are no invalid inputs.
